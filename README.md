# feature_based_fake_review_detection
This repository presents the code and datasets related to my Master Thesis for Marketing Analyticas. Within the code section you can locate the data preperation and cleaning, features extraction code (linguistic features and sentiment features), feature selection code using RFE, and machine learning code with analysis.

In my thesis, i have researched to what extent a machine learning algorithm can detect fake reviews using only linguistical and sentimental features in e-commerce and which linguistic and sentimental features are most effective. We used an Amazon-dataset that was labeled reviews as fake or real.
