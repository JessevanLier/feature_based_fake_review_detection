# It’s Time to get Real: Investigating the Effectiveness of Linguistic and Sentimental Features in Identifying Fake Review
This repository presents the code and datasets related to my Master Thesis for Marketing Analyticas. Within the code section you can locate the data preperation and cleaning, features extraction code (linguistic features and sentiment features), feature selection code using RFE, and machine learning code with analysis.

In my thesis, I have researched to what extent a machine learning algorithm can detect fake reviews using only linguistical and sentimental features in e-commerce and which linguistic and sentimental features are most effective. .

# Data Description 
I used an Amazon-dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lievgarcia/amazon-reviews). The reviews are labelled as fake or real (in the dataset they’re mapped fake (__label1__) or real (__label2__). The data set contains a series of other features for each review (rating, verified purchase, product category, product ID, product title, review title, review text). The corpus is made up of 21,000 reviews, equally distributed across product categories (10.500 fake reviews, 10.500 real reviews)
